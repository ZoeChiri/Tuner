# Python Tuner README ðŸŽ¼
## Overview
This is a basic Python tuner designed to help users with pitch. The program listens to the audio input from your microphone and provides real-time feedback on the pitch being played. The tuner works as intended, identifying the pitch of the incoming sound, but the user interface (UI) is a work in progress. Future updates will include visual cues to indicate whether the user is off-pitch.

## Features
Detects the pitch of the input sound using your computer's microphone.
Displays the detected note name (e.g., A4, G#3).
Works with a variety of instruments (guitar, piano, etc but focusing on voice) that produce a clear pitch.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+

## Libraries:

numpy
sounddevice
scipy
matplotlib (for future UI enhancements)

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.

## Work in Progress
I updated the UI.
